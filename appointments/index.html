<h2>My approach to client care</h2>

<p>I launched my own practice so I could spend appropriate quality time with each of my clients.  I was frustrated by the treatment time limits imposed by insurance companies and institutional care providers intent on satisfying their own corporate productivity metrics.</p>

<p>My approach centers around flexibility to treat as needed based on a client’s particular diagnosis and issues.  I work in partnership with my clients to understand the root cause of their issues and then to achieve goals through my body-as-a-system and PRI treatment approaches (described <a href="{{ site.url }}/#db-homepage-text-location">here</a>).</p>

## Payments and insurance

I am currently out of network for all insurance companies except Medicare.

I operate on a “fee-for-service” basis: clients pay for each treatment session via check, credit card, debit card, flex spending account or cash, and I provide a comprehensive “super-bill” that clients can use to submit claims to their insurer or to save towards insurance deductibles. I recommend that prior to the initial visit, clients call the consumer service phone number on their insurance card to understand how their out-of-network benefits work.

A typical treatment session lasts 1 hour. The initial session is $200, and subsequent sessions are $160/hour.
