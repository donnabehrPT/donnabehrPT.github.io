I have had scoliosis since I was a teenager and the curve in my spine never caused me any back pain until I was 25. As a former college athlete, I was devastated when my back started hurting and preventing me from living an active lifestyle. 

Working with Donna and incorporating PRI into my daily routine has been a life changing experience. As a nurse, I am most impressed with Donnaâ€™s clinical expertise and ability to know exactly how to target my back pain with tailored exercises. As a patient, I am most grateful for her compassion, patience, and dedication to healing. 

There is no cure for scoliosis, but Donna has shown me how to tackle my back pain and heal myself. She has shown me how to strengthen my body so I can live an active lifestyle.
