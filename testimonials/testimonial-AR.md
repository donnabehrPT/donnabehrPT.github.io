Last year when I was experiencing sharp back that prevented me from my regular running routine I visited Donna per the recommendation of my Dad. Donna was extremely kind, patient and willing to get to the root of my issues. She went above and beyond the call of duty by not only working with me to get me back into better physical condition with a lot less pain but also helped me to realize that my back issues stemmed from a long horse back riding career in which I overarched my back. Donna provided me with exercises and detailed reference materials that made it easy for me to go back after our sessions and practice on my own, giving me the tools to heal myself.
