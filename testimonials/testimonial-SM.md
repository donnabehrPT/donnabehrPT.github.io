This testimonial was easy to write.

I was haunted by lower back pain for two and a half years and worked with three physical therapists before I was referred to Donna. Donnaâ€™s ability to assess and diagnose my elusive back pain was exceptional. Beyond that, Donna taught me to care for my back for years to come.

I now use several targeted exercises and stretches to maintain my mobility. As a result, I am living pain-free and have returned to my former active lifestyle.

Not only was Donna effective, but she is a pleasure to work with...and very patient.
