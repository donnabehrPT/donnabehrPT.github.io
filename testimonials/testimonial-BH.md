Donna is a physical therapist of the highest caliber; extensively trained in her expertise of PRI, endlessly curious about how the body really works and boundless in her dedication to creating quality outcomes. She is a devoted professional who has helped me surpass my expectations for recovery from a niggling back ailment that I had come to tolerate but was definitely interfering with my activity level and quality of life.

Having worked in rehabilitation myself, I am well aware of what it takes to be the best. Donna, is the best with her advanced level of clinical expertise, high standards of care PLUS the ability to create a great team WITH me as the patient. I always felt part of the process and exceptionally well-educated on my role in my own recovery. I am more than pleased that I am now able to take long unencumbered beach walks with my dog on the beach AND am taking a dance class! At age 62, I never even imagined that would be within my reach and am so glad that dance is part of my life again.
