Frankly, I was skeptical. How would blowing up balloons help my back pain? You have to be kidding. But Donna was right, it does work.

After 30 years of lower back pain, I had previously found ways to compensate but this time nothing was working. I was referred to Donna and she recommended an entirely different approach from everyone else I had previously worked with. I learned that I was not breathing properly and that I needed to work my upper body, not just my back and legs.

She is an expert in her field and a pleasure to work with. Her style was supportive and encouraging but also adamant that I do my exercises properly. Armed with both exercises and a better understanding of my body, I have now been pain free for over 6 months. Biking, golf has been no problem this year and I am looking forward to skiing the bumps! Thanks Donna
