I have suffered with Plantar Fasciitis for over 6 years in my right foot. I went through multiple PT visits, cortisone shots, heel inserts and finally ended with surgery. Yes... my right foot was an extreme case so when I started having the same symptoms with my left foot, I thought I would have to go through another 6 years of hell! Then I was referred to Donna through my Podiatrist, Neil Feldman. 

When I first met Donna and she discussed the PRI process, I must admit I was skeptical, especially from all of my previous experiences. How could blowing up a balloon help my foot? However the day after my first appointment I knew it was no joke and I began the path of recovery. She has a great sense of humor and we could make great light of conversations during some challenging exercises. 

After 3 visits the pain started subsiding. As the exercises became more complex, Donna was positive and supportive every step of the way. I worked with Donna for about 8 visits and then I was on my own. It has been 3 years and I have been running/exercising consistently with no pain in my left or right foot. I have incorporated her exercises into my work out and often perform some of the breathing exercises while driving. I would recommend Donna for any patient that needs to try a different approach and is committed to a better quality of life.
