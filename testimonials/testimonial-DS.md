Donna is exceptional, both professionally and personally. 

Professionally, she always sought new methods for treating a challenging condition. She suggested new ideas and resources that aided me in my recovery. She is clearly passionate about her craft, and it shows. She continually explained to me new methods she had learned from a conference or a recent publication. This was often very helpful to my treatment. 

Personally, Donna is caring and sincerely wants to help her patients. In the current state of hurry-up medicine, Donna is a unique find. She always provided a full treatment session, and made time available to treat whenever possible. I cannot recommend Donna highly enough. Donna is the best!
