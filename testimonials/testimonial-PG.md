Having struggled for months with a very painful foot, I was referred to Donna by a wise doctor who believed my pain was due primarily to my posture. 

Donna worked with me intensively during the few weeks prior to a planned walking vacation, which I worried was going to be a disaster. Amazingly--success! I was able to walk comfortably and enjoy my trip. After few more sessions with her effective guidance (Use your arms while you walk!), I was pain free and now had important lessons to use for the rest of my life. 

Somehow Donna is able to translate and apply the rather esoteric theories and techniques of PRI to each individual. I admire her extensive knowledge and patience, combined with a dedication to staying current with the latest findings in her field. These qualities plus her perpetually upbeat personality make Donna a truly amazing resource. Highly recommended!
